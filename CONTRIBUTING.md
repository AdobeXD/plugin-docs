## Gitbook Configuration

The GitHub Pages rendering of this documentation is generated using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/). To preview this rendering locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run book:install
npm run book:build

# Now the generated Gitbook site is in a '_book' folder. It's best viewed from
# http://localhost (not file://), so start a local web server, e.g.:
http-server -c-1 _book
```

### Adding pages

When adding an entirely new documentation page to this site, be sure to add the new file to the correct location in `SUMMARY.MD`. Otherwise your content will not be rendered when the site is published.
