## React

## SceneNode
A [SceneNode](./reference/scenegraph.md#scenenode) represents a node within the user's scenegraph.

## Scenegraph
A scenegraph represents the user's document. It is so called because it is a tree (a kind of graph) of nodes that, when taken together, represents the entire "scene" of the document. Adobe XD [provides an API](./reference/scenegraph.md) for manipulating the scenegraph. [Learn more about the scenegraph](./reference/core/scenegraph.md).
