# Welcome to XD Plugin Guides and Samples site!
Are a problem solver? Do you know what JavaScript is? Do you want to extend Adobe XD? If so, this page is the right place for you. You can easily get started building an Adobe XD plugin by reading guides and learning from existing sample plugins.

## What can you build?
Adobe XD plugins provide a way for developers to extend XD functionality. Plugins can manipulate objects on canvas and alter their properties.
- **Change the properties of objects.** Plugins can change border, fill, opacity, and other object properties without direct user interaction.
- **Add and remove items on canvas.** Your plugin can add rectangles, paths, text, and other shapes to the canvas. Using paths, almost any two-dimensional object can be created.
- **Automate and extend user actions.** Plugins can automate repetitive actions and free users to focus on content.
- **Bring in user's files.** Plugins can load files from user's local drive.
- **Connect to other sources on the web.** Plugins can make network requests.
