## interactions
The `interactions` module provides global information about the document's interactive prototype mode. You can also access information from
specific nodes in the scenegraph via [`SceneNode.triggeredInteractions`](./scenegraph.md#SceneNode-triggeredInteractions) and [`Artboard.incomingInteractions`](./scenegraph.md#Artboard-incomingInteractions).

The blue "wires" seen in XD's prototyping UI are the most prominent piece of interactivity data, but other settings also affect the behavior
of the interactive prototype, such as [`homeArtboard`](module_interactions-homeArtboard), Artboard [`viewportHeight`](./scenegraph.md#Artboard-viewportHeight), and
node [`fixedWhenScrolling`](./scenegraph.md#SceneNode-fixedWhenScrolling).
