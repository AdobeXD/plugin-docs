"Plugins must add nodes one at a time, not entire subtrees"

"To create containers with children (subtrees), use commands."
"To create containers forming separate edit contexts (special subtrees), use commands." - FUTURE

"Plugin made a change outside the current edit context"

"Plugin ... is not permitted to make changes from the background. Return a Promise to continue execution asynchronously."
"Plugin ... is not permitted to make changes from the background. Use editDocument() for panel UI handlers, or return a Promise to extend an edit operation asynchronously."

"Panel plugin edits must be initiated from a supported UI event"

"Cannot start another edit from UI event ... while editDocument is already executing"

"Panel plugin edit initiated with event type '...' must include a valid mergeId" - OBSOLETE?

"Artboards must be grouped contiguously at bottom of canvas z-order"

"Plugins are not currently permitted to run inside a locked-down linked symbol instance" - OBSOLETE?
