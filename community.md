# Community

Looking for help or community support? Want to discuss the APIs with other developers? You've come to the right place! There are several community destinations based upon your needs.

* The [developer forums on adobexdplatform.com](forums.adobexdplatform.com) are a great place to ask questions, get community support, share tips and tricks, and more.
* Got a specific question? [Stack Overflow](#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/adobe-xd) might be the best place. Use the `adobe-xd` tag when asking questions.
* Got an bug report? [File them and vote for others on the developer forums](https://forums.adobexdplatform.com/c/xd/api-bugs).
* Want a feature in the APIs? [File and vote for others on the developer forums](https://forums.adobexdplatform.com/c/xd/api-requests).
* Want to file a bug report or feature request for XD itself (not API-specific)? See the [Uservoice forum](https://adobexd.uservoice.com/).
* If you want to engage with users of XD who use your plugins, check out the [Adobe XD user forum](https://forums.adobe.com/community/adobexd).
