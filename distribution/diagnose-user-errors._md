First, assess the problem:
- did plugin fail to install? check Plugin Manager UI and make sure it's listed as installed, and it's not disabled/failed

## Troubleshooting plugin install errors
if plugin failed to install, likely solution is to try again & make sure network connection isn't flaky

## Troubleshooting plugin runtime errors
if plugin is installed, but not behaving correctly or UI is missing...

Find any error messages & stack traces:
- debugging won't work
- use Plugins > Developer > Developer Console
- if problem happened in the past & can't be reproduced again, check AdobeXD.log (relative to Plugins > Developer > Show Develop Folder)

Once you have error logs:
- check the stack trace to see which line of your plugin code it points to
- if your plugin is calling an XD API and XD code is throwing the error, read the error message carefully -- then check the documentation for that API to make sure you're using it correctly
- if you think the problem is a bug in XD (or you can't figure out how to get the API to work), post in [forums]
- if it looks like an API is _missing_ check what XD version the user has and compare that to the API docs to see what version the API was added in -- it's possible your plugin manifest's `minVersion` isn't set high enough, allowing users with an older XD release to install your plugin even though it depends on APIs that only exist in never versions of XD
