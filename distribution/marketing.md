# Marketing your plugin

No matter how you plan to distribute your XD plugin, your marketing must follow Adobe's branding guidelines. We want you to be able to promote your plugin while protecting Adobe's corporate and product brands and trademarks.

For details, make sure to read the [Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Brand Guide](https://partners.adobe.com/content/dam/tep_assets/public/public_1/documents/Adobe-Creative-Cloud-Developer-Brand-Guide.pdf).

The brand guide includes best practices for brand assets in marketing, press releases, and social media, and is the best spot to get our most up to date assets. You’ll also find information for how to publicize and promote your plugin once it’s approved.
