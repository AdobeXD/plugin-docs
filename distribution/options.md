# Distribution options

Once you have a packaged plugin, you're ready to distribute. You can make your plugin available to users through the XD in-app plugin manager or via direct distribution.

## Prerequisite

- [A packaged plugin](/guides/how-to-package-a-plugin/README.md)

## The XD plugin manager

The XD plugin manager lets users discover and install XD plugin right from within the app. Installation is as easy as a single click.

## Direct distribution

Direct distribution lets you choose how to provide users with access to your plugin. Your website? Email? Cloud file share? It's up to you! 

If you distribute a .XDX file, installation is as simple as one double-click.
