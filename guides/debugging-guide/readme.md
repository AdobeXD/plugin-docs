# How to Debug Your Plugin

Bugs happen! In this guide, you will learn how to debug your Adobe XD plugin.

## Prerequisite

At least one plugin in your `develop` folder (you can create one using our [Quick Start guide](/guides/quick-start-guide)).


## Debugging Steps

During development, if your plugin is misbehaving, there are few things you can do to investigate the problem.

### 1. Look for errors in the developer console

You can see error messages your plugin may be causing with the XD developer console. 

The developer console can be opened from the _Plugins_ menu: _Plugins > Development > Developer Console_.


### 2. Try reloading the plugins

You can reload all plugins in your `develop` folder from the _Plugins_ menu: _Plugins > Development > Reload Plugins_.

There's also a handy keyboard shortcut:

| Platform      | Menu item          |
| ------------- | -------------      |
| macOS         | Shift-Cmd-R        |
| Windows       | Ctrl-Alt-E         |

If there are any errors blocking the plugin from loading, they will appear in the developer console on reload:

### 3. Try logging messages to the developer console

The example code below does not appear to be creating the "Hello!" text as expected.

Let's try adding a "start message" and an "end message" into `sayHello()` to double-check that the code is starting and running all the way to the end:

```js
function sayHello(selection) {
  console.log("sayHello started!");         // log a message

  const el = new Text();
  el.text = "Hello!";
  el.styleRanges = [
    {
      length: el.text.length,
      fill: new Color("#FFFFFF")
    }
  ];

  selection.insertionParent.addChild(el);
  el.moveInParentCoordinates(100, 100);

  console.log("sayHello ran to the end!");  // log a message
}
```

Your `console.log` messages will appear in the developer console:

![start-message](/images/readme-assets/start-message.png)

It looks like the function is running... maybe there is another problem.

![wrong-color](/images/readme-assets/wrong-color.png)

Oops, the fill color set by the plugin is `#FFFFFF`, which is white: the same color as this artboard's background.

You can verify this with a `console.log` message:

```js
console.log("el fill color =" + el.fill);
```
