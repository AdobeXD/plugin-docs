## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript
- At least one plugin in your `develop` folder (you can create one using our [Quick Start guide](/guides/quick-start-guide))


## Debugging Steps

### 1. Open the Developer Console

In order to see the error messages your plugin may be generating, or to `console.log` messages from your code, you will need to open the XD Developer Console. The developer console allows you to see errors and plugin-generated logs while executing plugins. 

The developer console is enabled from the Plugins menu:

| Platform      | Menu item          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| macOS         | Plugins->Development->Developer Console |
| Windows       | Plugins->Developer Console |

### 2. Try reloading the plugins

Reload the plugins in XD by either quitting and reopening the app, or using the handy keyboard shortcut:

| Platform      | Menu item          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| macOS         | Plugins->Development->Reload Plugins (Shift-Cmd-R) |
| Windows       | Plugins->Reload Plugins (Ctrl-Alt-E) |

If there are any errors blocking the plugin from running, they will appear in the developer console on reload:

### 3. Try adding `console.log` messages to your code

The example code below, which is adapted from the [Quick Start guide](/guides/quick-start-guide), does not appear to be creating the "Hello!" text as expected.

Let's try adding a "start message" and an "end message" into `sayHello()` to double check that the code is running:

```javascript
function sayHello(selection) {
  console.log("sayHello started!");

  const el = new Text();
  el.text = "Hello!";
  el.styleRanges = [
    {
      length: el.text.length,
      fill: new Color("#FFFFFF")
    }
  ];

  selection.insertionParent.addChild(el);
  el.moveInParentCoordinates(100, 100);

  console.log("sayHello ran to the end!");
}
```

Your `console.log` messages should appear in the developer console:

![start-message](/images/readme-assets/start-message.png)

It looks the function is running... maybe there is another problem.

![wrong-color](/images/readme-assets/wrong-color.png)

Oops, the fill color set by the plugin is `#FFFFFF`, which is white: the same color as this artboard's background.

You can verify this with a `console.log` message:

```javascript
console.log("el fill color =" + el.fill);
```
