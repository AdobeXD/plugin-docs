# How to package a plugin

Before you share your plugin, you'll need to package it up.

This guide describes how to package the files of an XD plugin. It's a simple process that can be summarized in three words: _compress_, _rename_, and _verify_.


## Prerequisite
- A code-complete plugin (if you don't have one yet, try our [Quick Start Tutorial](/guides/quick-start-guide))


## Workflow

### 1. Compress your files as a .zip file

Select all files within your plugin's parent folder. On both macOS and Windows you can right-click to compress:

| Platform      | Menu item          |
| ------------- | -------------      |
| macOS         | Right-click > Compress # items |
| Windows       | Right-click > Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder |

> **tip**
> Compressing the plugin's _parent_ folder is not recommended as it complicates the requirements for filenames. Instead, compress the _contents_ of the parent folder.


### 2. Rename the .ZIP extension to .XDX

Adobe XD recognizes the .XDX file extension as an XD plugin. 

By using this file extension, your plugin automactically gets the "double-click to install" feature, meaning that if you share your plugin directly to users, all they have to do is double-click to install the plugin to Adobe XD.

If you plan to submit your plugin for distribution via the XD plugin manager, renaming your .ZIP to .XDX is required.


### 3. Verify the packaging worked

Try double-clicking your .XDX file. It should prompt you to install the plugin: 

<img src="/images/readme-assets/package-plugin-steps/install.png" width="50%" height="50%">

Click install:

<img src="/images/readme-assets/package-plugin-steps/installed.png" width="50%" height="50%">

You'll get a success message upon installation, after which the plugin will show up in XD.


## Next steps

You've packaged your plugin! Now you're ready to distribute your plugin.
