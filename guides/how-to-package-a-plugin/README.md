# How to package a plugin.
This guide describes how to package the files of an XD plugin.

It is a prerequisite to have a working plugin with all the files that you intend to package.

Please note the screenshots are from a mac machine but the steps would be identitical on a windows machine.

## Development Steps

> **Info**
> Complete code for this plugin can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/AdobeXD/Plugin-Samples/tree/master/getting-started).

### 1. Compress the content as a .zip file.

Select all files > Right click > click the option to compress

_Note: If you create a parent folder of the content and compress the folder, the name of the resulted `.zip` file should match the parent folder name for the package to be installed correctly. Since there is a chance users change the name of the compressed file, we recommend you to compress the content directly instead of creating a parent folder_

Here's how the .zip file should look like.
