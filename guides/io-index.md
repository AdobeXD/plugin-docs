# Working with I/O

If you want your plugin to go beyond the document to work with local files or web services, you'll want to learn about our file I/O and network I/O APIs. These tutorials will help you connect your XD plugin with the wider world: import from and export to the local machine, integrate with OAuth, or make network requests.
