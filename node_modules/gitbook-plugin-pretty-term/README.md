Feel free to make a pull request if you want to add your book to the list!

## How to install
Add `pretty-term` to your `book.json` plugins, like so:
```
{
    "plugins": ["pretty-term"]
}
```
Don't have a `book.json` in the root of your book? That's fine! You can just make one and copy the above in.

## How to use
Use the `term` and `endterm` markdown blocks:
```
{% term %}
    npm i -g @nrwl/schematics
{% endterm %}
```

## How to get up and running in development
To develop the plugin, you need to follow the [Setup and Installation of GitBook](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/setup.html).

You can point plugins at the local git repository for development, like this:
```
{
    "plugins": [
        "pretty-term@git+~./path/to/repo/gitbook-plugin-pretty-term"      
    ]
}
```
Then run `gitbook install` and `gitbook serve`. Make sure you're using some `{% term %}` blocks in your test book otherwise you won't see any terminal!

Enjoy :)
