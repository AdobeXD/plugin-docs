this information\.

.SS SCRUBBING
.P
In order to ensure that potentially sensitive information is not included in
the audit data bundle, some dependencies may have their names (and sometimes
versions) replaced with opaque non\-reversible identifiers\.  It is done for
the following dependency types:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Any module referencing a scope that is configured for a non\-default
registry has its name scrubbed\.  (That is, a scope you did a \fBnpm login \-\-scope=@ourscope\fP for\.)
.IP \(bu 2
All git dependencies have their names and specifiers scrubbed\. 
.IP \(bu 2
All remote tarball dependencies have their names and specifiers scrubbed\.
.IP \(bu 2
All local directory and tarball dependencies have their names and specifiers scrubbed\.

.RE
.P
The non\-reversible identifiers are a sha256 of a session\-specific UUID and the
value being replaced, ensuring a consistent value within the payload that is
different between runs\.
