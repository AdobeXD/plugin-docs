# Plugin API Roadmap

We've got a lot of stuff planned for the future of the Adobe XD platform, and we've built out a roadmap. Take a look around, and if you've got a suggestion for an API feature, please make a request on [the Adobe XD Platform forums](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/tags/c/adobe-xd/xd/8/feature-request).

> **Tip**
>
> If you want to request a feature for Adobe XD itself, please make the request on the [Adobe XD UserVoice forum](https://adobexd.uservoice.com/).
