# JavaScript version and feature support

XD plugin APIs support "modern JavaScript"... but what does that mean exactly? 

This is the place to find out!


## Can I use ES5 features?

Yes! This means you can use `Array#map`, `Array#reduce`, and numerous other language features introduced with ES5.

In fact, you can write your whole plugin in ES5 if you so choose.


## What ES2015+ (ES6) features can I use?

XD plugin APIs support most of ES2015 and beyond. You can use features such as:

- Template literals
- Classes
- Block-scoped variables ( `let` , `const` )
- Object destructuring
- Default parameters
- Spread and Rest ( `...` )
- Arrow functions
- Asynchronous functions ( `async` / `await` )
- Promises


## Can I use require?

Yes, you can use `require` to import additional files.

Note that `require` in XD does not follow Node.js-style resolution. You can only require files in your plugin directory relative to your file location, but not outside of your plugin directory. There is no lookup in a `package.json` or a `node_modules` directory.

For example, the following works:

```js
const aFile = require("./aFile");
const someJSON = require("./someJSON.json");
const anotherFile = require("./path/to/file/file");
const someLib = require("./node_modules/somelib");
```

However, the following will not:

```js
const someLib = require("somelib");  // no package.json lookup
```


## Can I use nmp packages or Node.js APIs?

You may be able to use some npm packages without modification, but chances are good that youâ€™ll need to use webpack or rollup in order to generate a bundle.

Node.js APIs themselves are not supported.
