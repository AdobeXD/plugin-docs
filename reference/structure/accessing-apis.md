#### Accessing APIs

See [Available APIs](../core/apis.md) for a listing of different APIs and how to access them. Most APIs are loaded using `require()`,
but a few can be accessed directly as globals, and some key API objects are passed directly to your command handler function
([see menu item handlers](./handlers.md)).
