# The `manifest.json` file

The manifest is where you include metadata about your plugin. Simply put, the manifest is a list of facts about your plugin in the form of a JSON object. No executable code goes into your manifest.

## Example manifest

```json
{
    "id": "YOUR_ID_HERE",
    "name": "Name of Your Plugin",
    "version": "0.0.1",

    ],
    "host": {
        "app": "XD",
        "minVersion": "13.0",

        }
    ]
}
```

## Top-level metadata

The top level of the manifest JSON object contains high-level information about your plugin.
> **Info**
> Here are the definitions of the keywords in the "Required" column:
> - Develop - required field for XD to run the plugin. If excluded, XD won't load the plugin
> - Publish - required field for plugins to be submitted in the I/O Console and published in the Plugin Manager
> - Optional - optional field for all plugins

Key path | Type | Description | Required
---------|------|-------------|---------
`id`     | `string` | Unique identifier for your plugin. You can get your unique ID on the [Adobe I/O Console](https://console.adobe.io/plugins).| Develop / Publish

Name availability can be checked on your plugin details page on the [I/O Console](https://console.adobe.io/plugins).<br> The name should be 3 - 45 characters. <br> **Note:** Your plugin name is independent of the _project name_ you created when getting your plugin ID from the I/O Console. The I/O Console project name is for your reference only, and is managed directly on the I/O Console. | Develop / Publish
`version`| `string` | Version number of your plugin in `x.y.z` format. <br>Version must be three segments and each version component must be between `0` and `99`. | Develop / Publish

Currently, only the following codes are allowed: `en` (English), `de` (German), `fr` (French), `ja` (Japanese), `ko` (Korean), `zh` (Chinese), `es` (Spanish), `pt` (Brazilian Portuguese). <br>This field will be displayed in the Plugin Manager to users when "See details" is clicked.  | Publish
`website` | `string` | Web address for information about your plugin. <br> This field will be displayed in the Plugin Manager to users when "See details" is clicked. <br>The URL should follow the standard URL format and not exceed 1000 characters.| Optional
`author` | `string` | Plugin author's name. <br> This field will be displayed in the Plugin Manager to users. <br> Name should be 3 - 40 characters.| Publish
`helpUrl` | `string` | Web URL for your plugin's support/help page. <br> This field will become visible in the Plugin Manager to users when "See details" is clicked. <br> The support page you link to must include information on how to get support. <br> The URL should follow the standard URL format and not exceed 1000 characters. <br> **Note:** For GitHub repositories, you should link to a `README.md` file or other Markdown file that describes how to file an issue, or link directly to an issue submission form. _Do not link directly to your repo's list of issues._ | Publish
`icons` | `array<object>` | Icons displayed in the Plugin Manager listing. <br> PNG, JPG/JPEG formats are supported and the max file size for each icon is 1MB. <br> All five sizes are required - `[24, 48, 96, 144, 192]`. | Publish
`host.app` | `string` | Indicates that this is a plugin for Adobe XD (currently, the only valid value here is `"XD"`). | Develop / Publish
`host.minVersion` | `string` | Minimum required version of the host app (in `x.y` format) that can run this plugin. <br> **Note:** Must be two segments. Typically, you'll leave the minor segment set to `0`, e.g. `16.0`. | Develop / Publish
`host.maxVersion` | `string` | Maximum version of host app that can run this plugin. Same formatting as `host.minVersion`. | Optional
`uiEntryPoints` | <code>array&lt;[MenuItemDefinition](#MenuItemDefinition)&gt;</code> | Describes the entries your plugin adds to the _Plugins_ menu & "plugin launchpad" sidebar in XD. See the next section for details. | Develop / Publish

## UI entry points

The `uiEntryPoints` field is an _array_ of objects matching the MenuItemDefinition format specified below. These entries appear both in the _Plugins_ menu in the native menubar, and the "plugin launchpad" sidebar panel. See [Plugin menu structure](/reference/structure/menu-structure.md) for details on how these entries are displayed.

Each entry point specifies either `commandId` _or_ `panelId`, to create either a direct-action command or a panel show/hide command.

### MenuItemDefinition

Key | Type | Description
----|------|------------
`type` | `string` | Entry point type: either `"menu"` or `"panel"`.
`label` | <code>?string&#124;[LocaleMap](#menu-localization)</code> | _Required_ if multiple `MenuItemDefinition` objects defined; _ignored_ if only one defined.<br><br> Label for this menu item that the user will select to run your plugin. May be a single string _or_ a dictionary of localized strings. 
`commandId` | `string` | Specify `commandId` to create a menu item that runs plugin code directly -- either a headless command, or a command with modal dialog box UI. This identifier links the menu item to a [_handler function_](./handlers.md#command) in your plugin's JavaScript code. This identifier needs to be unique within your plugin. Don't specify `commandId` and `panelId` at the same time.
`panelId` | `string` | Specify `panelId` to create a menu item that opens panel UI for your plugin. This identifier links the menu item to a [_panel definition_ object](./handlers.md#panel) in your plugin's JavaScript code. This identifier needs to be unique within your plugin. Don't specify `commandId` and `panelId` at the same time.
`shortcut` | `Object` | _Optional._ Object defining Mac and Windows keyboard shortcuts for this menu item. See "Keyboard shortcuts" below for details.

### Keyboard shortcuts

**Example:** `"shortcut": { "mac": "Cmd+Shift+P", "win": "Ctrl+Shift+P" }`

Keyboard shortcuts are defined separately for each platform. Each definition is a string that follows this syntax:

* One or more modifier keys, in any order, each one followed by `"+"`
    * _Mac:_ modifiers may be `Cmd`, `Ctrl`, `Opt` / `Alt`, or `Shift`. Shortcut _must_ contain at least one of `Cmd` or `Ctrl`.
    * _Win:_ modifiers may be `Ctrl`, `Alt`, or `Shift`. Shortcut _must_ contain `Ctrl`.

* A letter or number key.
    * Letters are case-insensitive (e.g. `"Cmd+P"` and `"Cmd+p"` mean the same thing and neither requires pressing Shift).
    * Other keys (including punctuation, arrow keys, or F1-F12) are currently _not supported_.

> **Info**
> If your shortcut collides with a built-in XD command _or_ another plugin's shortcut, your shortcut will be ignored and you'll see a warning printed to the [developer console](/tutorials/debugging/#1-look-for-errors-in-the-developer-console).

## Menu Localization

Plugin menu item labels or panel labels can be localized to match XD's current UI language setting. Other manifest fields such as `name` and `description` _cannot be localized yet._

Localized labels are represented as an object containing multiple translations, instead of a single string value:

```json
"label": {
    "default": "Menu Label",
    "fr": "Etiquette de Menu",
    "de": "MenÃ¼bezeichnung"
}
```

A default string is always required. The language must be a two-letter code from [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), _not_ a hyphenated code such as `en-US`. To avoid inconsistency with the rest of XD's built-in menu items, languages that aren't supported by XD are ignored.

> **Info**
> You can also localize strings that appear in your plugin's own dialog UI, by choosing which strings to use in your UI based on the value of [application.appLanguage](../application.md#module_application-appLanguage).
