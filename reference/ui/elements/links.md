# Links

Links are used to open the user's default web browser to the specified web address. Links should be short and concise while also avoiding ambiguity.

{% tabs linkmac="Example (macOS)", linkuwp="Example (Windows)", linkcode="HTML" %}

{% content "linkmac" %}

![macOS Link](assets/macOS%20Link.png)

{% content "linkuwp" %}

![Windows Link](assets/Windows%20Link.png)

{% content "linkcode" %}

```html

{% endtabs %}

## Guidelines

##### Where to Use Links

* Don't put links inside of headers.
* Note that because XD doesn't support inline layout, it isn't possible to put links inline with other content. If you do so, the link will render as a block element.

##### Provide Context

* Don't just use link text like "click here". Give the user some context as to what your link will do.
