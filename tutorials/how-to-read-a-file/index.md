# How to read a file

This tutorial will show you how an XD plugin can read in a file from the file system. As one of example of what you can do with a file, we'll extract text from the file and add that text to the scenegraph.


## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [Quick Start Tutorial](/tutorials/quick-start)
- [Debugging Tutorial](/tutorials/debugging/index.md)

## Development Steps

> **Info**
> Complete code for this plugin can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/AdobeXD/Plugin-Samples/tree/master/how-to-read-a-file).


### 1. Prepare your plugin scaffold

First, edit the manifest file for the plugin you created in our [Quick Start Tutorial](/tutorials/quick-start).

Replace the JSON object in your manifest with the one below, noting the changes for the following fields:

1. `id`
1. `name`
1. `uiEntryPoints[0].label`
1. `uiEntryPoints[0].commandId`

```json
{
    "id": "ID_FROM_IO_CONSOLE",
    "name": "Insert Text from File",
    "host": {
        "app": "XD",
        "minVersion": "13.0.0"
    },
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Description of your plugin.",
    "summary": "Summary of your plugin",
    "languages": [
        "en"
    ],
    "author": "Your Name",
    "helpUrl": "https://mywebsite.com/help",
    "icons": [
        { "width": 48, "height": 48, "path": "images/icon01x.png" },
        { "width": 96, "height": 96, "path": "images/icon02x.png" },
        { "width": 144, "height": 144, "path": "images/icon03x.png" },
        { "width": 192, "height": 192, "path": "images/icon04x.png" }
    ],
    "uiEntryPoints": [
        {
            "type": "menu",
            "label": "Insert Text From File",
            "commandId": "insertTextFromFileCommand"
        }
    ]
}
```

Refer to the full documentation of [manifest.json file](/reference/structure/manifest.md#top-level-metadata) to learn more.

Then, update your `main.js` file, mapping the manifest's `commandId` to a handler function.

Replace the content of your `main.js` file with the following code (note the presence of the `async` keyword, which we'll look at in a later step):

```js
async function insertTextFromFileHandler(selection) {
    // The body of this function is added later
}

module.exports = {
    commands: {
        "insertTextFromFileCommand": insertTextFromFileHandler
    }
};
```

The remaining steps in this tutorial describe additional edits to the `main.js` file.


### 2. Require in XD API dependencies

For this tutorial, we need access to two XD scenegraph dependencies and one UXP dependency.

Add the following lines to the top of your `main.js` file:

```js
// Add this to the top of your main.js file
const { Text, Color } = require("scenegraph");
const fs = require("uxp").storage.localFileSystem;
```

Now the `Text` and `Color` classes are required in and ready to be used, as well as UXP's local file system provider.


### 3. Create a handler function

Our plugin will allow the user to pick a file from the system file picker, read that file's contents, and add the contents to a text object on the scenegraph.

Each of the numbered comments are explained below the code:

```js
async function insertTextFromFileHandler(selection) {               // [1]
    const aFile = await fs.getFileForOpening({ types: ["txt"] });   // [2]
    if (!aFile) return;                                             // [3]

    const contents = await aFile.read();                            // [4]

    const text = new Text();                                        // [5]
    text.text = contents;
    text.styleRanges = [{
        length: contents.length,
        fill: new Color("#0000ff"),
        fontSize: 12
    }];

    selection.insertionParent.addChild(text);                       // [6]
    text.moveInParentCoordinates(10, 30);
}
```

1. This example uses XD's asynchronous Filo I/O APIs, so the handler function must be declared as an async method. To learn more about async support in XD plugin APIs, see [our document on sync and async support](/reference/javascript/sync-async.md).
2. A file picker dialog is displayed, and the function waits for the user to select a text file. The selected file is assigned to `aFile`. The `#getFileForOpening` method is asynchronous, so the `await` keyword is used.
3. If `aFile` is undefined (because the user did not select a file), then plugin exits.
4. The contents of the file is read in, and returned as a string. See below for more detail. The `#read` method is asynchronous, so the `await` keyword is used.
5. The contents of the string is added to a `Text` object. For details on `Text` properties, see the "[How to style text](/tutorials/how-to-style-text)" tutorial.
6. The `text` object is added to and positioned on the selected artboard.


### 4. Run the plugin

After saving all of your changes, reload the plugin in XD and run it. First you'll see a file picker:

If you select a file containing text, the text should be added to the currently-selected artboard:
