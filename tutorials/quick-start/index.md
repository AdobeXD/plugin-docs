# Quick Start: Make your first XD plugin

Let’s walk through creating your first Adobe XD plugin together.

We'll keep things simple in this Quick Start tutorial. Once you're done, you'll have a solid grasp of the steps to take when starting to create your own XD plugin.

At the end of the tutorial, we'll suggest some next steps for going deeper with the XD plugin APIs.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A text editor to write your code in (like VSCode, Sublime Text, Brackets, Atom, etc)

## Development Steps

> **Info**
> Complete code for this plugin can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/AdobeXD/Plugin-Samples/tree/master/quick-start).

### 0. Get a plugin ID from the I/O Developer Console

Before you start, you'll want to create a plugin project on the Adobe I/O Developer Console.

1. [Go to the I/O Console and sign in or sign up](https://console.adobe.io/plugins)
1. Click "Create Plugin"
1. Create a plugin project by giving it a project name and clicking "Create Plugin". Note that this project name is not public; it is only visible to you and can be changed directly on the Console later.
1. On the following page, get the 8-character unique plugin ID in the "Plugin Details" section.
1. Optionally on the same page, download the starter project, which contains a functioning Hello, World sample plugin.

We'll use your plugin ID in one of the next steps.

### 1. Identify where your plugins are located

Adobe XD loads plugins that are in development from a `develop` folder in a specific location on your machine. To get to that folder, simply go to this menu item: _Plugins > Development > Show Develop Folder_.

This will open the `develop` folder, which we'll use in the next step.

### 2. Create your plugin scaffold

Next, you'll need to make a new folder within the `develop` folder to store the plugin files that you'll create below. Name your new plugin folder anything you like.

Now, let's create your plugin files. Open your favorite text editor and create two files inside of your new plugin folder with these _exact_ names:

1.  `manifest.json`

This file includes information about the plugin, such as its name, the menu item(s) it adds to XD, and so on.

[Learn about the manifest here](/reference/structure/manifest.md).

2.  `main.js`

This file contains your JavaScript code that implements your plugin's functionality.

[Learn more about `main.js` here](/reference/structure/handlers.md).

These two files go into your plugin's parent directory. When you have the right structure, it will look like this:

```
my-plugin-folder
├── main.js
└── manifest.json
```

It's possible to have more files if you want, but these files are the bare minimum requirement for your plugin to work, and are all we'll need for this Quick Start tutorial.

### 3. Create your plugin’s manifest

In the previous step, you created a file named `manifest.json`. Open that file and paste in this JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "YOUR_ID_HERE",
  "name": "Hello World sample plugin",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Description of your plugin.",
  "summary": "Summary of your plugin",
  "languages": ["en"],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "helpUrl": "https://mywebsite.com/help",
  "host": {
    "app": "XD",
    "minVersion": "13.0"
  },
  "uiEntryPoints": [
    {
      "type": "menu",
      "label": "Create Rectangle",
      "commandId": "createRectangle"
    }
  ]
}
```

Be sure to replace the `id` value with the unique plugin ID you got from the I/O Console in the first step:

```json
"id": "1234ABCD",
```

If you're curious about what each entry means, [see the manifest documentation](/reference/structure/manifest.md), where you can also learn about all manifest requirements for a plugin to be published in the XD Plugin Manager. 

The value of the `commandId` property may be any string; in this case, it's `createRectangle`. In the next section, we will see how this string is associated with the code for our plugin.

### 4. Create your plugin’s code

Next, we need to create the JavaScript code for our plugin. The code lives in a file named `main.js`, which we created in step #2.

Paste this code into `main.js`:

```js
// [1]
const { Rectangle, Color } = require("scenegraph");

// [2]
function rectangleHandlerFunction(selection) {
  // [3]
  const newElement = new Rectangle();
  newElement.width = 100;
  newElement.height = 50;
  newElement.fill = new Color("Purple");

  // [4]
  selection.insertionParent.addChild(newElement);
  // [5]
  newElement.moveInParentCoordinates(100, 100);
}

// [6]
module.exports = {
  commands: {
    createRectangle: rectangleHandlerFunction
  }
};
```

This code does the following:

1.  Gets references to the `Rectangle` and `Color` classes from XD’s `scenegraph` module. There are several different [API modules you can load using `require()`](/reference/core/apis.html).
2.  Defines our handler function. The handler function will run when the user selects the _Plugins > Create Rectangle_ menu item.
3.  Creates a new `Rectangle` object with width, height, and color properties.
4.  Adds the `Rectangle` object to the scenegraph at the top-left (coordinates `0, 0`).
5.  Puts the `Rectangle` object at coordinates `100, 100` within the parent element.
6.  Exports an object, with a `commands` property. The value of `commands` is an object which associates the JavaScript handler function (`rectangleHandlerFunction`) with your manifest's `commandId` property. The command ID property name (here, `createRectangle`) must match the `commandId` value declared in your manifest exactly.

### 5. Run your plugin

So you’ve written a plugin! How do we run it?

If you haven’t already done so, launch XD and open a new document. Then navigate to the _Plugins > Create Rectangle_ menu item.

Alternatively, if XD was already open, select _Plugins > Development > Reload Plugins_.

Congratulations! You’ve built your first plugin for Adobe XD!
