# How to make a simple network request

Adobe XD plugins can make [network requests](how-to-make-a-network-request-guide.md#TODO) using [`XMLHttpRequest`](how-to-make-a-network-request-guide.md#TODO) and [`fetch`](how-to-make-a-network-request-guide.md#TODO). Plugins can also use the [`Websocket`](how-to-make-a-network-request-guide.md#TODO) API as well, but that is beyond the scope of this guide.

In this guide, we'll create a plugin that can request information from a remote server using `fetch`.
