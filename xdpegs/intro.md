# XD Plugin Experience Guidelines

> **Danger**
>
> The XD Plugin Experience Guidelines are being drafted now, and are likely to change before release. Even so, you should be able to use these guidelines to craft compelling user experiences for your users.


The **XD Plugin Experience Guidelines** (XDPEGs) can be used to ensure that your plugin is functional in a variety of edge cases and provides a good experience to your end users. While it’s not a hard-and-fast requirement that you follow the XDPEGs when submitting your plugin for review to the Plugin Manager, it is highly suggested that you try to follow the guidelines when and where it makes sense. Doing so ensures that your users have a good experience with both your plugin and Adobe XD itself.

> You aren’t required to follow the XDPEGs when building plugins for you, your team, or your enterprise. It’s still suggested that you do follow them when sharing your plugin, however, because we’ve tried to identify the common guidelines that ensure for a good user experience.
